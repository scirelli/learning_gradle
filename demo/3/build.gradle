//Gradle has 3 lifecycle phases: initialization, configuration, and execution.
//Execution: is the phase in which build tasks are executed in the order required by their dependency releationships.
//Configuration: is the phase in which those task objectsa re assembled into an internal object model, usually called the DAG (directed acyclic graph).
//Initalization: is the phase in which Gradle decides which projects to participate in the build. Important phas in multiproject builds.
